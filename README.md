## Snapshot Application

Key Experiences:

- CLI tool creation
- complete application development needing considerations in design and functionality (modularity, OOP, testing)
- extensive work with the pandas library
- independent research and development

In my current Data Analyst role I have to produce monthly reports that show a "snapshot" of the different programs we have at our non-profit. Prior to my arrival these reports were generated with a fair amount of human effort. A lot of the work was put on the analyst was to follow a recipe for getting the snapshot. A lot of the steps involved transforming data. The process involved using a combination of Access and Excel. I wrote this software to do the job of crunching the numbers and running the necessary analysis to save myself, and any future analysts, the headache of jumping between tools and having to manually make transformations. 

I saw a great opportunity to update how my organization was processing data and gradually began to work on the application with whatever time I had between different projects. No ML or advanced analytics is used in the software but it gave me good experience with creating a full application rather than just a single Python script. I had to consider software design, useability, and testing. 

The application is not perfect. I know there are some things (especially in terms of consistency, and I have not profiled the code) that need to be revisited, but I have not had the time to yet. It also would have been nice to have a senior developer to mentor me, but that is not this type of organization; if I was going to build this, it was going to be me, documentation, and google. Nonetheless,  the tests pass and the results are generated much faster than a human could return results.

## Capstone Project (Computer Vision x ML)

Key Experiences:

- designing/developing data engineering pipelines
- delivering under high pressure and at a fast pace (single semester to research and develop)
- persisting an ensemble of models and using in production
- automating python application with .bat file and Windows Task Scheduler


In the final semester of my master's, the cohort was split into teams to bid on corporate projects. My team selected the computer vision project. The details will be high-level due to our corporate sponsor owning the IP of our algorithm. 

The class followed the [Lean LaunchPad methodology ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_Launchpad) for startups. We definitely got the experience of working in an agile, start-up type environment. We all had to wear many hats, acting as marketers, researchers, and developers. We conducted interviews with our client(sponsor) to make sure the product we were making was on track and would deliver business gains--pivoting when needed. 

The technology for the product we were making exists ([essentially what we were building](https://rossum.ai/)) but we were determined to make our product from scratch. 

I took on the tasks of designing and writing the code for data engineering. The data engineering pipeline had to take PDF files and convert to tabular data sets. Deciding on the structure of those data sets was not trivial. There were a few times where the pressure was on and we could have failed to deliver a product. Getting the data sets into a useable structure for ML was one of those times. But we delivered.

I also took on a large part of writing the production code. This gave me  experience in writing software with embedded ML models. 


## Machine Learning Internship

Key Experiences:

 - S3, Elastic Beanstalk, SageMaker, EC2, boto3
 - remote development (ssh through VSCode to develop on host)
 - API development in Flask to serve ML
 - wrote script to upload to S3

The details of what I built at this internship cannot be disclosed. However, I can share my experiences in some ways. 

This ended up being a two semester internship for me. For about the first half of the internship I was able to work with the project leader, a DevOps guy dabbling in ML, to become familiar with the project. It was an application in Natural Language Processing (NLP). The ML was familiar to me, but I was given valuable experience learning AWS resources. I was able to learn one-on-one with a DevOps professional how to use S3, SageMaker, EC2, and Elastic Beanstalk. 

My DevOps mentor left not long into my second semester of the internship. This was a side project for the software company I was interning with so the team was only as big as it needed to be. We hired another intern from my UCF cohort, but I was the one with the most experience on the ML side of the project. I found myself in somewhat of a leadership position... as an intern.

Really what that meant was more pressure, same pay. But I was in it for the experience anyway so I was excited to be the "go-to" for the ML stuff and the infrastructure stuff. I had the "know-how" for deploying to Elastic Beanstalk, so I was the one to write the API that served the ML model. There were times when the infrastructure stuff left me stumped, but I was able to learn on the fly and keep at anything that was blocking our way to the end product. I delivered, and my intern buddy delivered what was assigned to him. 

I left the company after the second semester ended and passed on everything I knew to my intern buddy. I enjoyed my experience in the internship and learned material impossible to pick up in a classroom setting.
