## Snapshot Application

Key Experiences:

- CLI tool creation
- complete application development needing considerations in design and functionality (modularity, OOP, testing)
- extensive work with the pandas library
- independent research and development

In my current Data Analyst role, I must produce monthly reports that show a "snapshot" of the different programs we have at our non-profit. Prior to my arrival, these reports were generated with a fair amount of human effort. A lot of the work put on the prior analyst involved transforming data. The process involved using a combination of Access and Excel. I wrote this software to do the job of crunching the numbers and running the necessary analysis to save myself, and any future analysts, the headache of jumping between tools and having to manually make transformations. 

I saw a great opportunity to update how my organization was processing data and gradually began to work on the application with the time I had between different projects. No ML or advanced analytics is used in the software, but it gave me good experience with creating a full application rather than just a single Python script. I had to consider software design, usability, and testing. 

The application is not perfect, but I am incrementally introducing new features and updating old features to better solve business needs. I am constantly learning more about software development as this project grows.

## Capstone Project (Computer Vision x ML)

Key Experiences:

- designing/developing data engineering pipelines
- delivering under high pressure and at a fast pace (single semester to research and develop)
- persisting an ensemble of models and using in production
- automating python application with .bat file and Windows Task Scheduler


In the final semester of my master's program, our cohort was split into teams to bid on corporate projects. My team selected the computer vision project. The details will be high-level due to our corporate sponsor owning the IP of our algorithm. 

The class followed the [Lean LaunchPad methodology ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_Launchpad) for startups. We got the experience of working in an agile, start-up type environment. We all had to wear many hats, acting as marketers, researchers, and developers. We conducted interviews with our client to make sure the product we were making was on track and would deliver business gains--pivoting when needed. 

I took on the tasks of designing and writing the code for data engineering. The data engineering pipeline had to convert PDF data to usable tabular data sets. Deciding on the structure of those data sets was not trivial. There were a few times where the pressure was on and we could have failed to deliver a product. Getting the data sets into a usable structure for ML was one of those times. But we delivered.

I also took on a large part of writing the production code. This gave me experience in writing software with embedded ML models. 


## Machine Learning Internship

Key Experiences:

 - S3, Elastic Beanstalk, SageMaker, EC2, boto3
 - remote development (ssh through VSCode to develop on host)
 - API development in Flask to serve ML
 - wrote script to upload to S3

The details of what I built at this internship cannot be disclosed. However, I can share my experiences in some ways. 

I interned with this company for two semesters. For about the first half of the internship, I was able to work closely with the project leader and became familiar with the project. The project was an application in Natural Language Processing (NLP). The ML was familiar to me, but I gained valuable experience learning AWS resources. I was able to learn, one-on-one with a DevOps professional, how to use S3, SageMaker, EC2, and Elastic Beanstalk. 

My DevOps mentor left not long into my second semester of the internship. This was a side project for the software company I was interning with, so the team was only as big as it needed to be. The company hired another intern from my UCF cohort, but I was the one with the most experience on the ML side of the project. I found myself in somewhat of a leadership position... as an intern.

While this put more pressure on me, I was in it for the experience. I was excited to be the "go-to" for the ML and infrastructure aspects of the project. I had the "know-how" for deploying to Elastic Beanstalk, so I was the one to write the API that served the ML model. There were times when the infrastructure left me stumped, but I was able to learn on the fly and keep at anything that was blocking our way to the end product. I delivered, and my intern buddy delivered what was assigned to him. 

I decided to leave the company after my second semester on the project but mentored the other intern so he would be up-to-speed on the AWS resource usage. I stay in contact to assist here and there whenever a problem may come up. I enjoyed my experience in the internship and learned material impossible to pick up in a classroom setting.
