## Snapshot Application
In my current Data Analyst role I have to produce monthly reports that show a "snapshot" of the different programs we have at our non-profit. Prior to my arrival these reports were generated with a fair amount of human effort. A lot of the work was put on the analyst was to follow a recipe for getting the snapshot. A lot of the steps involved transforming data. The process involved using a combination of Access and Excel. I wrote this software to do the job of crunching the numbers and running the necessary analysis to save myself, and any future analysts, the headache of jumping between tools and having to manually make transformations. 

I saw a great opportunity to update how my organization was processing data and gradually began to work on the application with whatever time I had between different projects. No ML or advanced analytics is used in the software but it gave me good experience with creating a full application rather than just a single Python script. I had to consider software design, useability, and testing. 

The application is not perfect. I know there are some things (especially in terms of consistency, and I have not profiled the code) that need to be revisited, but I have not had the time to yet. It also would have been nice to have a senior developer to mentor me, but that is not this type of organization; if I was going to build this, it was going to be me, documentation, and google. Nonetheless,  the tests pass and the results are generated much faster than a human could return results.


## Capstone Project (Computer Vision x ML)

Key Experiences:

- designing/developing data engineering pipelines
- writing software with embedded ML models
- delivering under high pressure and at a fast pace (single semester to research and develop)
- persisting an ensemble of models and using in production
- automating python application with .bat file and Windows Task Scheduler


In the final semester of my master's, the cohort was split into teams to bid on corporate projects. My team selected the computer vision project. The details will be high-level due to our corporate sponsor owning the IP of our algorithm. 

The class followed the [Lean LaunchPad methodology ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_Launchpad) for startups. We definitely got the experience of working in an agile, start-up type environment. We all had to wear many hats, acting as marketers, researchers, and developers. We conducted interviews with our client(sponsor) to make sure the product we were making was on track and would deliver business gains--pivoting when needed. 

The technology for the product we were making exists ([essentially what we were building](https://rossum.ai/)) but we were determined to make our product from scratch. 

I took on the tasks of designing and writing the code for data engineering. The data engineering pipeline had to take PDF files and convert to tabular data sets. Deciding on the structure of those data sets was not trivial. There were a few times where the pressure was on and we could have failed to deliver a product. Getting the data sets into a useable structure for ML was one of those times. But we delivered.

I also took on a large part of writing the production code. This gave me  experience in writing software with embedded ML models.
